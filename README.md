# ✨ Core Features
📖 Comprehensive Information Hub: A clean, multi-page section providing detailed, step-by-step guides on the process, eligibility, and required documents for both Learner's and Permanent driving licenses.

🧠 Interactive Practice Quiz: A dynamic quiz with questions and images related to Indian road signs and traffic rules. The options are lettered (A, B, C, D) to simulate a real test environment.

💻 Full-Stack Architecture: Built with a Python and Flask back-end that serves pages and handles the quiz logic, and an HTML/Tailwind CSS front-end for a modern and responsive user experience.

🌐 API-Driven Quiz: The quiz dynamically fetches questions from a back-end API, checks user answers, and provides instant feedback, demonstrating a clear separation between the front-end and back-end.
